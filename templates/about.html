                        <p>This blog platform was developed as part of a college assignment for my programming module,
                            the aim was to build a simple web application using Flask to manage blog posts so that the
                            user can view, read, edit, delete and even add their own blog posts!</p>
                        <p>Want to contribute your own story? Head over to the <a href="{{ url_for('create_blog') }}">Create Blog</a> page and share your own blog.</p>
